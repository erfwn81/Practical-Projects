Here I am doing my projects that I have for my school. The first one is about Dice-Rolling-Gamble-Game: in this game the player can gamble virtually by using 2 dices and they should try to match an 8-digit number that comes from the combination of dice rolls to a random number chosen by the computer, and based on how many digits match they can win more money. I also created a Calculator in Python that performs add, subtract, multiply, and divide functions with expression evaluation and error handling, along with a Calculator in C that does the same with proper zero-division checks. Another project is the Zoo Management System in Python, which stores animals with their details and classifies them based on the number of legs, and the Bookstore Inventory System in C, which lets users interactively add or remove books from inventory until they choose to quit.
